# VIP ImageJ/FIJI plugin (WIP)

VPT Image Preprocesor - ImageJ plugin intended for use with VPT Framework 

---
This plugins' main use case is preparing multichannel confocal microscopy images, to be converted into raw multichannel stacks.

The raw data will then be able to be passed through a raw2BVP conversion tool, which may be integrated into the plugin in the near future.
