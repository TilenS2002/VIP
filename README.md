# ImageJ/FIJI plugin for preprocessing microscope images(WIP)

This plugins' main use case is preparing multichannel confocal microscopy images, to be converted into raw multichannel stacks.

The raw data will then be able to be passed through a raw2BVP conversion tool, which may be integrated into the plugin in the near future.
